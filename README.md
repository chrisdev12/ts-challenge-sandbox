# Algorithms & Big Notations

Big O notation describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms. In summary, it is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity). Big-O notation can express the best, worst, and average-case running time of an algorithm

## O(n²) -> Quadratic time

O(n²) means that the calculation runs in quadratic time, which is the squared size of the input data.

In programming, many of the more basic sorting algorithms have a worst-case run time of O(n²):

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort

## PairSumFinder algorithm

- We define the PairSumFinder algirhtm "efficient" as faster than O(n^2) and "correct" as returning the correct results for all possible inputs.
